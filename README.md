# Spotify Data Analysis

## Overview:
This project involves analyzing a Spotify dataset with various attributes about tracks, albums, and artists using SQL. It covers an end-to-end process of normalizing a denormalized dataset, performing SQL queries of varying complexity (easy, medium, and advanced), and optimizing query performance. The primary goals of the project are to practice advanced SQL skills and generate valuable insights from the dataset.

## Steps performed in the project:
### 1. Data Exploration
Before utilizing SQL for data analysis, it is essential to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset. The dataset includes the following attributes:

Artist: The performer of the track.
Track: The title of the song.
Album: The album in which the track is featured.
Album Type: The classification of the album (e.g., single or full album).
Additional Metrics: Various attributes such as danceability, energy, loudness, tempo, and other relevant characteristics.

### 2. Querying the Data
Once the data has been inserted into the database, SQL queries can be utilized to explore and analyze it. These queries are categorized into three levels—easy, medium, and advanced—to facilitate progressive learning and skill development in SQL.

Easy Queries: Basic data retrieval, filtering, and simple aggregations.
Medium Queries: More complex queries incorporating grouping, aggregation functions, and joins.
Advanced Queries: Complex operations such as nested subqueries, window functions, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and performance optimization techniques.

### 3. Query Optimization
At an advanced level, emphasis is placed on enhancing query performance. Some key optimization strategies include:

Indexing: Implementing indexes on frequently queried columns to improve retrieval speed.
Query Execution Plan: Utilizing EXPLAIN ANALYZE to assess and refine query performance for efficiency.
